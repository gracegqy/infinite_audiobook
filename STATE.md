## Phase table

| Phase | Status | Gate | Gate evidence (command/check + result) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Scaffold | DONE | Scaffold gate (TASKS.md §0) | all items re-verified from artifacts 2026-07-18 (Entry 3); Grace review approved (Entry 4) |
| 1 — Pre-design probes | DONE | All 6 probe questions answered in probe_results.txt | All six answered (probe_results.txt gate block; Entries 5–11); probe 5 closed on Grace's four phone reports; one deferral w/ risk note (≥5-min backgrounding → Phase 4 gate) |
| 2 — Design | DONE | DESIGN.md frozen; Grace sign-off | Grace signed off v0.3 in session ("I sign off DESIGN v0.3", Entry 15); DESIGN header now FROZEN v1.0; AMENDMENTS 02/03 flipped to BINDING; §11 traceability covers R1–R15 |
| 3 — Pipeline MVP | DONE | One story end-to-end, playable audio + offsets | Grace: "Phase 3 gate passed" (Entry 17); Yellow Wallpaper READY, 32 tests green, offsets 0 ms drift, spot-check OK (Entry 16) |
| 4 — Player MVP | [IN PROGRESS] | Full listen on phone over Tailscale | App built + browser-verified end-to-end on a sandboxed DB copy (Entry 19); 60 tests green; server running at http://100.117.147.107:8123; GATE (Grace's phone test) not yet run |
| 5 — Queue + sync + channels | not started | Queue self-heals to 5; sync visible on phone | — |
| 6 — Preference adaptation | not started | Curation demonstrably weighted by ratings | — |
| 7 — Hardening | not started | Fresh-session audit + runbook complete | — |

## Confirmed findings

- Sourcing = classics + modern web fiction, private-use only; TTS = Kokoro-local first
  with OpenAI fallback; hosting = Mac + Tailscale; Anthropic + OpenAI keys exist
  (interview, docs/BRIEF_VERBATIM.md).
- Pipeline is channel-driven (editable genre/language/topic criteria), not
  horror-hardcoded (docs/AMENDMENT_01).
- Git identity/remote conventions: personal repos use account `gracegqy`, identity
  Grace / graceguqianying@uchicago.edu (verified across ACTIVE repos, `git config` +
  `git remote -v`). GitHub credential present in macOS keychain (`git credential fill`
  returned a password for github.com).
- Kokoro runs locally at ~6.9x realtime (probe 1, 2026-07-18); per-paragraph
  synthesis + concat gives exact offsets (probe 2, energy-check verified). Quality
  verdict pending Grace's listen.
- Curation signal is real: named checkable reputation lists for both classic and
  NoSleep channels; PD/modern classification correct on 3 hand spot-checks (probe 3).
- Gutenberg + creepypasta-wiki fetch/clean work (with empty/deleted-page validation
  needed); Reddit anonymous JSON API is dead — OAuth app or HTML parsing required
  (probe 4; decision in Phase 2).
- Kokoro "random pauses" bug root-caused: newline-split chunking from hard-wrapped
  input text, fixed by whitespace normalization (probe 1b). Design constraint: clean
  stage must unwrap lines within paragraphs. Grace re-listens to *_fixed.* files.
- OpenAI TTS fallback confirmed working: $0.004/paragraph, ~$0.32/30-min story
  (probe 6, 2026-07-18).
- Tailscale installed on Mac + iPhone; Mac Tailscale IP 100.117.147.107. Probe 5
  server running on it (page 200, range 206 re-verified from Mac, Entry 9).
- iOS lock-screen/Media-Session controls work: title shows, skip buttons perform the
  handler's ±15s (icons cosmetically show Apple's default "10s"); playbackRate honored
  (R13 viable). Sustained ≥5-min backgrounding deferred w/ risk note to the Phase 4
  gate (Entry 11).
- iOS resume works on the real target: kill Safari + reopen resumes at saved position,
  scrubbing works (Grace retest, Entry 9). Design rules: apply resume seeks
  loadedmetadata-or-later, never at page init; AND on `ended`, clear/complete the
  resume position and mark the story read — never persist end-of-file as a resume
  point (Entry 10: a finished story "resumed" to its end, causing instant
  ended→pause that looked like broken playback).
- .env exists with both keys (verified gitignored).
- TTS is per-language config, all gates decided (probe 1c, Entries 12–14):
  en = Kokoro · fr = Kokoro ff_siwis (passed) · zh = edge-tts zh-CN-YunxiNeural
  (Grace's "verdict a", Yunxi > Xiaoxiao; Kokoro zh rejected — "weird accents";
  edge-tts caveats accepted: $0 cloud call, undocumented endpoint, degrade rule =
  OpenAI TTS per story on failure) · ja untested, out of scope. edge-tts currently
  installed only in the probe venv — pipeline env must add it (Phase 3).

## Next actions

1. **Grace: run the Phase 4 phone gate** (TASKS §4) — server already running at
   http://100.117.147.107:8123 (restart anytime: `scripts/serve.sh`): start a
   story, scrub, ±15 s, background ≥5 min, kill Safari + reopen → resumes within
   2 s of the pause point. Evidence goes to JOURNAL.
2. At Phase 4 close: run the 3 review angles still owed on the Phase 3 diff
   (removed-behavior, reuse, efficiency — Entry 16; the Phase 4 diff got all 8
   inline, Entry 19).
3. Phase 5 (queue worker + sync + channels UI) per TASKS. Owed nearby: Entry-16
   debts (source-class registry, edge-tts fallback granularity, stored
   source_ref, vocab-genre coupling).

## Library

5 ready stories, all kokoro/af_heart (Entry 19): Yellow Wallpaper 32.2 ·
Monkey's Paw 22.0 · Owl Creek Bridge 20.9 · Damned Thing 18.0 · Willows 107.1
min. Voice gallery: 11 samples in data/voice_samples/.

## Open decisions

1. Settings screen (curation model selector, R14/DESIGN §6) needs a store for
   the chosen model → small `settings` table = schema change on the frozen
   design; amendment proposal awaiting Grace (could bundle Entry-16's "stored
   source_ref" column). Until then Phase 4 ships without the settings screen.

DESIGN FROZEN v1.0; AMENDMENTS 01–04 all FULLY BINDING (Entry 18).
